 * Conceived of, collaboratively designed, and oversaw development of an
   automated program “Rack-and-Roll,” greatly simplifying the process
   of adding new hardware into the lab.

   networking problems, service outages, etc.

 * Integrated new products into our existing testing and networking
   infrastructure.
